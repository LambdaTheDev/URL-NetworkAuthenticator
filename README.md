# URL NetworkAuthenticator
When I was creating my project based on Mirror networking system for Unity, I had a big problem with creating NetworkAuthenticator that validates data in the Internet.

I asked many people for help, and finally I did this. I share it here, so less people in future will waste their time on finding own solution.
